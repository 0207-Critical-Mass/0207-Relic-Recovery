# Brake Toggle

## Rationale
At the end of the match, we want to make sure the drivers can easily get back onto the balancing plate. However, doing this requires very fine control to end up balanced on the plate. This is a hard to accomplish feat, due to the drivers being forced to quickly react to being on the plate, in addition to the inherent lag in a FTC robot. One feature the drivers felt would be useful was a mode which greatly slowed down and stopped the robot immediately. We implemented this in the Brake toggle
