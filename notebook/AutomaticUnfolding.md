# Automatic Unfolding of the Robot

## Rationale

As part of our robot's design, it is highly compact at the beginning of the match, to allow for the full robot to fit into the proper size limits. However, this poses a problem, as the bot should be able to unfold itself. If not for use in auton, at the very least this would allow the drivers to start a match more smoothly, as they do not need to think about the order in which the robot's part need to be moved to unfold the robot and allow it to operate completely, while simulatenously not tearing the entire robot apart from trying to have a part move through another.
