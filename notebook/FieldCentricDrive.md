[]# Field Centric Drive
 
## Rationale
This year, we wanted to try a new driving mechanic: Field Centric Drive. We felt that offering the drivers multiple ways of controlling the robot will allow them to have greater choice in which way to control. One driver may prefer a normal robot centric drive, while another may prefer a field centric model. Additionally, field centric drive is especially useful for Relic Recovery, there was a decent chance of having frequent turns of the robot, which can be hard for a driver to adjust to. While this problem was eliminated by the build team, by designing an active intake that pulls glyphs through the entireity of the bot, it was a concern that drove us to create a field centric drive for the robot
