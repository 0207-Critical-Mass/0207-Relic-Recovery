[11:48 AM] Weznon | 0207 Critical Mass: our phone is getting passed a null reference for the hardwareMap
[11:48 AM] Weznon | 0207 Critical Mass: Is there some issue with our coding that could cause this
[11:49 AM] Weznon | 0207 Critical Mass: Because we don't think we changed anything that would be related to the hardwaremap
[11:49 AM] EthanS - 12670 Eclipse: that's really strange. Is your hardware map declared on the phone?
[11:49 AM] Weznon | 0207 Critical Mass: Yeah

[11:50 AM] Weznon | 0207 Critical Mass: This is the file in question, it's the only class common among all of the op modes
[11:50 AM] Weznon | 0207 Critical Mass: The issue occurs on all our teleops and auton
ü§î1
[11:52 AM] Joshua  | FTC 9889: Did you calibrate the BNO055IMU?
[11:52 AM] The60th -8397: Whats the object that is null?
[11:52 AM] Weznon | 0207 Critical Mass: the hardwareMap iteself is null
[11:52 AM] The60th -8397: your calling ur init methodright?
[11:52 AM] Weznon | 0207 Critical Mass: we tried to cailbrate the imu but the teleop we use for that crashes before it can run
[11:53 AM] The60th -8397: can you link a teleop/auto program?
[11:54 AM] Joshua  | FTC 9889: https://github.com/Dwight-Englewood-Robotics/0207-Relic-Recovery/blob/master/ftc_app/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/Telebop.java @The60th -8397 Maybe this code for teleop?

[11:54 AM] Weznon | 0207 Critical Mass: yeah
[11:54 AM] BOTUseless Internet Points: Neatarini @Weznon | 0207 Critical Mass, you just advanced to level 3 !
[11:54 AM] Weznon | 0207 Critical Mass: thats the main one we use
[11:54 AM] Weznon | 0207 Critical Mass: is the issue with the setting robot with a consturctor
[11:54 AM] Weznon | 0207 Critical Mass: i feel like we didnt do that beforehand
[11:55 AM] Weznon | 0207 Critical Mass: nvm we did
[11:55 AM] The60th -8397: should work fine
[11:55 AM] The60th -8397: you might have to make a class based hardwaremap then asign that, (thats how I do it) but it should work how it is
[11:55 AM] Joshua  | FTC 9889: DId you triple check the config file?
[11:56 AM] The60th -8397: can you copy paste the full error?
[11:56 AM] Weznon | 0207 Critical Mass: it was on the phone, we dont have access to phone right now
[11:56 AM] Weznon | 0207 Critical Mass: we can get the error in 30 minutes
[11:56 AM] The60th -8397: dang, do you remeber the wording?
[11:57 AM] The60th -8397: Note i normally use linearOpMode so not sure how a raw extends opMode works
[11:57 AM] The60th -8397: but my thought would be the 
        @Override
        public void init() {
            robot.init(hardwareMap);
        }
[11:57 AM] The60th -8397: maybe thats not called somehow?
[11:57 AM] Joshua  | FTC 9889: That should work
[11:57 AM] The60th -8397: And that would lead to a null hardwaremap when you try and assign values
[11:57 AM] Joshua  | FTC 9889: LinearOpMode extends OpMode
[11:58 AM] Joshua  | FTC 9889: init just runs once
[11:58 AM] The60th -8397: Yeah
[11:58 AM] Weznon | 0207 Critical Mass: the error was somrhting along the lines of
[11:58 AM] Weznon | 0207 Critical Mass: failed to run method get from the hardwaremap class
[11:58 AM] The60th -8397: init -> initLoop - > start -> loop?
[11:58 AM] Weznon | 0207 Critical Mass: on a hardwaremap object because the object was null
ü§î1
[11:59 AM] The60th -8397: okay
[11:59 AM] The60th -8397: 
public void init(HardwareMap hardwareMap) {}

That hardwareMap is coming in as null if i understand correctly
[12:00 PM] Weznon | 0207 Critical Mass: yeah, that makes sense
[12:00 PM] Noah | OpenFTC | 8528 Mentor: Do a null check. That should not be null. Make absolutely sure that it's the hardwareMap that is null
üëçüèª1
[12:00 PM] The60th -8397: ^^
[12:00 PM] Weznon | 0207 Critical Mass: that would be like a try catch around teh hardwaremap stuff right
[12:00 PM] The60th -8397: if you can, run the program when your connected to the adb debugger
[12:00 PM] Noah | OpenFTC | 8528 Mentor: Write to the RobotLog it's status
[12:00 PM] The60th -8397: so you can use break points
[12:01 PM] EthanS - 12670 Eclipse: literally just if(hardwareMap = null) { telemetry.addLine("hw map gone"); telemetry.update(); }
[12:02 PM] Noah | OpenFTC | 8528 Mentor: do that, but also write to the RobotLog. I think the telemetry will disappear if your OpMode ends right away
[12:02 PM] The60th -8397: ^
[12:03 PM] Weznon | 0207 Critical Mass: ok, ill try that, thanks for the help
[12:03 PM] EthanS - 12670 Eclipse: just add a Thread.sleep(10000) before the use of the hardware map
[12:03 PM] Weznon | 0207 Critical Mass: ill be back later with how it goes
